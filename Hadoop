 - Hadoop
	- Difference between hadoop-1 and 2
	- NameNode vs DataNode vs EdgeNode vs GatewayNode vs MasterNode (NameNode=MasterNode and EdgeNode=GatewayNode)
	- 3 modes of Hadoop (how will you config the mode: mapred-site.xml, core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, yarn-site.xml )
	- Job tracker and Task tracker in Hadoop-1 
	- Major Properties you can set in 
			hdfs-site.xml = dfs.blocksize, dfs.replication
			core-site.xml = fs.defaultFS(uri of namenode),
			yarn-site.xml = yarn.resourcemanager.address , yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address (uri of yarn)  
	- DataNode communication if it is down (whom and how) : NameNode every 3 secs default dfs.heartbeat.interval
	- MapReduce Job flow and internal working
	- Default block size and how you can change it (hdfs-site.xml : dfs.blocksize )
	- Why we are calling NodeManager as a manager (mention responsibility)
	- How secondary NameNode becomes primary NameNode (from where and which metadata log file : fsimage file)
	- Handle block size dynamically 
	- Word count using map reduce job
	- Will reducer class run on all the reducers in parallel
