 - Spark
	- Internal flow of spark-submit (multiple steps)
	- Driver and Executors
	- RDD/Dataframe(SchemaRDD)/Dataset/PairedRDD
	- register the UDF into spark SQL (sqlContext.udf.register(‚Äúalias_name_of_function‚Äù,function_name) )
	- ways to create a RDD (calling transformation on rdd, calling sc.textFile(‚ÄúfilePath‚Äù), sc. parallelize(Array("jan","feb","mar")))
	- cache and persist
	- broadcast and accumulator
	- RDD lineage vs DAG
	- Spark Program to identify even and odd
	- Transformation and Actions (check at least few)
	- How will you insert the record into RDD which already have data in it. And your data is structured. Don‚Äôt want to use spark-	   sql statements. (https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?api=org.apache.spark.sql.Row) 
	- Spark configurations for executors (what params you can set)
